The <code>corepers</code> module has many more arguments, such as:</p> <ul> <li><code>-t</code> : % (between 0 and 1) of the persistent genome: a family is considered as persistent if it contains exactly one member in at least tol% of the genomes, and is absent in all other genomes. Default value for t is 1, meaning that all genomes must have a unique member. This corresponds to the coregenome (so no need to put this option if you want a coregenome). More relaxed definitions of a persistent genome can be used by using -X or -M options (see below). <li><code>-X</code>: add this option if you want to relax a little the definition of the persistent genome, to get a mixed persistent genome. With -X option, a family is considered as persistent if at least tol% (tol defined by -t  parameter, see above) of the genomes have exactly one member in the family, but the other genomes can have either 0, either several members in the family. This is useful to add the families where, in some genomes, 1 protein has been split in several parts, because of sequencing or assembly error(s). <li><code>-M</code>: not compatible with -X. With this option, you get the multi persistent genome. It includes the strict and mixed persistent, but is even wider: the only condition for a family to be persistent is that it must have at least one member in at least tol% (tol still defined by -t  parameter) of the genomes (independent of the copy number)."},{"location":"03_Whole_%28pan%29genome_analyses/#step-5-aligning-the-sequence-of-core-gene-sequences","title":"Step 5: Aligning the sequence of core gene sequences","text":"Info <p>For each of our objects, we have an amino acid sequence and a nucleotide sequence. That is, we can do alignments of both. For biological analysis, the protein sequence is preferred because:</p> <ol> <li>Larger alphabet = more letter variants - 20 vs. 4 for nucleotide sequences.</li> <li>Amino acids have a more conservative structure (nucleotides are more variable, there are nonsynonymous substitutions, and amino acids are under stronger selection and it is easier for us to match conservative parts).</li> </ol> <p>However, when aligning amino acid sequences, we find it difficult to \u2018go back\u2019 and account for nucleotide substitutions. But there is a trick - we take the nucleotide sequences, translate them into amino acids and sort of align the amino acids, preserving the original triplets of nucleotides that were underneath those amino acids.</p> <p>Then:</p> <ul> <li>We can account for honest correct reading frame shifts - like a single nucleotide dropout in a nucleotide alignment (i.e. we allow for a situation that is impossible in an amino acid alignment).</li> <li>And at the same time we have information about the amino acid structure of the protein - a combination of two levels of information.</li> </ul> <p>Let's also break down the command below in parts:</p> <ul> <li><code>PanACoTA</code> - the name of the tool we are running.</li> <li><code>align</code> - module of this tool that aligns sequences with <code>mafft</code>.</li> <li>By key <code>-c</code> we pass the <code>PersGenome_PanGenome-EsMa.All.prt-clust-0.8-mode1.lst-all_1.lst</code> file.</li> <li>By key <code>-l</code> we pass the <code>LSTINFO-.lst</code> file from the Step 2.2..</li> <li>By key <code>-n</code> we pass the four-character name for the data, which was set previously.</li> <li>By key <code>-d</code> we pass the path to the output directory from Step 2..</li> <li>By key <code>-o</code> we specify where to store the output files.</li> </ul> <p>Input</p> <pre><code>PanACoTA align -c Coregenome/PersGenome_PanGenome-EsMa.All.prt-clust-0.8-mode1.lst-all_1.lst -l Annotation/LSTINFO-.lst -n EsMa -d Annotation/ -o Alignment\n</code></pre> <p>Let's go into the directory and look at the results.</p> <p>Input</p> <pre><code>ls Alignment\n</code></pre> <p>Output</p> <pre><code>Align-EsMa  PanACoTA-align_EsMa.log      PanACoTA-align_EsMa.log.err\nList-EsMa   PanACoTA-align_EsMa.log.details  Phylo-EsMa\n</code></pre> <p>We see a lot of log files.

Epub\n2008  Sep 26.\n\nA cyclophilin A inducible expressed in gonad of zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri.\n\nSong X(1), Wang L, Song L, Zhao J, Zhang H, Zheng P, Qiu L, Liu X, Wu L.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&amp;F University, Yangling, \nShaanxi, 712100, China.\n\nCyclophilin A (CypA), a receptor for the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A \n(CsA), is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) which accelerates the \ncis-trans isomerization of prolyl-peptide bonds, interacts with a variety of \nproteins and therefore regulates their activities. One CypA (designated CfCypA) \ncDNA was cloned from Chlamys farreri by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid \namplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. The full-length cDNA of CfCypA \nconsisted of 1,248 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence \nAATAAA, a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 495 nucleotides \nencoding a polypeptide of 164 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence \nshared high similarity with CypA from the other species, indicating that CfCypA \nshould be a new member of the CypA family. Quantitative real-time (RT) PCR was \nemployed to assess the mRNA expression of CfCypA in various tissues and its \ntemporal expression in haemocytes and gonad of scallops challenged with Vibrio \nanguillarum. The mRNA transcripts of CfCypA could be detected in all the \nexamined tissues with highest expression level in gonad. After bacterial \nchallenge, the expression level of CfCypA was almost unchanged in haemocytes, \nbut up-regulated in gonad and increased to the peak (22.59-fold; P &lt; 0.05) at 4 \nh post-injection, and then dropped to the original level at 8 h post-injection. \nThese results indicated that CfCypA was constitutive expressed in haemocytes, \nbut could be induced in gonad, and perhaps played a critical role in response to \nthe bacterial challenge in gonad.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s11033-008-9363-8\nPMID: 18819019 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n</code></pre> <pre><code>## Object of class 'efetch'\n## 1.
